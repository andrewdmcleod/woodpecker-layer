summary: Woodpecker layer - check remote network ports and test firewall rules
maintainer: Andrew McLeod <andrew.mcleod@canonical.com>
description: |
        Woodpecker will, by default, open port 31337 locally, and if it finds
        any peers, will check that port 31337 is accessible on those. The default
        port can be changed via configuration to multiple ports.
        Woodpecker will also test 'IP:PORT' combinations specified by config.
